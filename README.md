# Java_Chess
This is a simplified version of chess created in my Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures course in Spring 2023. This project is written in Java
and basically a game designed to mimic a typical chess game. This project was made collabatory with a partner, during the Spring semester, and 
is listed on the project files.
